      "- Use `describe_workspace` for a tree overview.\n",

      "   - Link styles via `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/src/styles.css\" />` or import CSS in JS.\n",
      "2. `src/index.jsx` mounts the app with React 18:\n",
      "   - `import React from 'react'`\n",
      "   - `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'`\n",

      "   - `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>)`\n",
      "3. `src/App.jsx` exports the root component. Use `.jsx` for any file that contains JSX unless you add `@vitejs/plugin-react` or a custom esbuild loader to treat `.js` as JSX.\n",
      "4. `package.json` with scripts:\n",
      "   - `dev: vite`, `build: vite build`, `preview: vite preview --port 5173`\n",
      "   - deps: `react`, `react-dom`; devDeps: `vite`.\n",
      "5. Add basic `styles.css` and import it (index.html or index.jsx).\n",
      "6. Provide README with install/run/build instructions.\n",
      "7. Add `.gitignore` entries for `node_modules/` and `dist/`.\n",

      "- If you scaffold with a tool (e.g., `npm create vite@latest`), run it in the project root and pass `.` as the target. Do NOT pass the project name when already inside the workspace (avoids nested `<name>/<name>` folders).\n",
      "\n",
      "Common pitfalls to avoid\n",
      "- Placing `index.html` inside `src/` for Vite projects (should be at repo root).\n",
      "- Using `<script src=\"app.js\">` in `index.html` instead of a module script to `/src/index.js`.\n",
      "- Writing JSX in `.js` files without the React plugin leads to esbuild errors like \"The JSX syntax extension is not currently enabled\". Use `.jsx` file extensions or install `@vitejs/plugin-react`.\n",
      "- Forgetting `package.json` scripts and dependencies.\n",
      "- Mixing absolute filesystem paths instead of workspace‑relative paths.\n",
      "- Omitting a clear README with run/build steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lessons learned (from prior runs)\n",
      "- Missing `package.json` prevented install/run.\n",
      "- `index.html` was put under `src/` and referenced `app.js`; switched to root `index.html` with a module script to `/src/index.jsx`.\n",
      "- JSX was authored in `.js` files causing esbuild JSX loader errors; renamed to `.jsx` to resolve without extra plugins.\n",
