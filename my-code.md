# user prefrence
- i dont like fallback in code, because i want the code to work exactly as i wanted with no supreises.
- i dont like imports in try/catch blocks
- if the project is python, i use most of the time and virtual python env in same project directory .venv
- alwayse update my preference here in this file, if i have new one that not mentioned here.
- always fix typo in this file and fix formating.
- i take this file with me always in new project and other workspace.
- in each project i have doc folder with index file in it as entry point, for new developer or agent so the can use it to know what they want to read if they want to add or chnage some project features. make sure those files are alwayse up to date.
