# User Preferences
- I do not like fallback logic; the code must behave exactly as specified with no surprises.
- Do not wrap imports in try/except blocks.
- For Python projects, I typically use a `.venv` virtual environment inside the project directory.
- Always update this file when a new preference appears anywhere else.
- Always fix typos and formatting in this file.
- I carry this file into every new project and workspace.
- Every project must include a `docs/` folder with an index file that serves as the entry point for new developers or agents. Keep those docs up to date.
- Configuration files must be YAML (not Python, Java, or other formats).
