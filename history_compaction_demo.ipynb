      "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a coding agent. Follow constraints strictly and prefer tool calls over verbose replies.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Create a polished, modern personal website that feels fast, friendly, and memorable, composed of six thoughtfully crafted sections that guide a visitor from first impression to action. Begin with a clean, persistent header that anchors the experience and provides effortless navigation: include a compact logo or nameplate on the left, a well-spaced horizontal menu on larger screens and a tidy menu button on small screens, and a clear visual indicator for the current page section. Make the header responsive and sticky so it remains visible while scrolling; add subtle hover and focus states for all interactive elements, generous hit targets for touch, and refined micro-interactions (for example, a soft underline that animates from the center outward). Ensure the header supports high-contrast themes, keyboard navigation, and proper aria attributes, and allow the user to toggle between light and dark modes with a single, accessible control persistently available in this area.\\n\\nFollow the header with a hero section that immediately communicates identity and value. Present a prominent, benefit-driven headline, a concise supporting paragraph that clarifies who you are and what problem you solve, and one or two primary calls to action (such as “View Projects” and “Get in Touch”). Pair the copy with a high-quality portrait, illustration, or abstract visual that scales gracefully on all devices. Introduce motion tastefully—perhaps a minimal parallax drift or a gentle fade-in on load—to add depth without harming performance; prefer CSS transforms and opacity transitions over layout-affecting animations. Provide alternative text for imagery, respect users’ reduced-motion preferences, and keep the content within an optimal reading width. Consider adding small trust elements—logos of past clients, a brief stats strip (years of experience, shipped projects, notable technologies), or a short testimonial—so credibility is established right away. Ensure the hero communicates a clear narrative arc in under eight seconds: who you are, what you do, and where the visitor should go next.\\n\\nDevelop a projects section that showcases selected work with clarity and purpose. Organize items in a responsive grid that shifts from a single column on mobile to two or three columns on larger screens. Each project card should include a compelling title, a one-sentence value statement, a small stack tag list (e.g., “TypeScript, React, Node, Postgres”), and a visual thumbnail that reveals more on hover or focus—such as a short caption or a looping, muted video demo with captions. Link each card to a dedicated project detail page or modal featuring a narrative case study: problem framing, constraints, your role, the process (research, ideation, execution), before/after comparisons, key decisions, measurable outcomes, and what you learned. Add optional filters or tabs (All, Frontend, Backend, Design, Writing) to help visitors browse. Provide badges for awards, press, or open-source stars when relevant. Optimize images with modern formats, include srcset sizes for crisp rendering, and lazy-load below-the-fold media. Use semantic markup (article/figure/figcaption) so assistive technologies can parse the content effectively.\\n\\nIntroduce an about section that feels personal yet professional. Lead with a short origin story that explains your motivation, followed by a compact timeline of milestones—education, roles, notable launches, speaking engagements, and community contributions—so visitors can quickly understand your trajectory. Include a photo or illustration that expresses personality without dominating the page; complement it with a brief list of values or operating principles (for instance: “clarity over cleverness,” “small, frequent iterations,” “accessibility as a baseline, not an add-on”). Provide a skills inventory grouped by category (Languages, Frameworks, Platforms, Tools, Methods) and emphasize proficiency with honest labeling (Proficient, Comfortable, Exploring) instead of ambiguous skill bars. Add links to resumes, press features, podcasts, or talks. If appropriate, embed a short video introduction with transcripts and captions. Keep the tone warm and succinct, and ensure that the section scales gracefully across breakpoints with adequate whitespace and line length for painless reading.\\n\\nDesign a contact section that lowers friction and invites conversation. Offer a simple form with labeled fields (Name, Email, Message) and optional structured choices (reason for contact: collaboration, speaking, mentoring, freelance). Validate in real time with accessible error messaging that clearly explains how to fix issues. Provide a privacy note that states what happens after submission, and a success message that sets expectations for response time. Include alternative contact paths—an email link, calendaring link for scheduling, or links to professional networks—clearly separated from social profiles used for casual updates. Implement spam protection that respects users (honeypot, time-to-complete checks, server-side validation) and avoid intrusive captchas when possible. On the backend, deliver submissions to an inbox and optionally a database with timestamps and metadata; send a friendly, branded auto-reply so senders know their message arrived. Make sure the form is fully operable via keyboard, supports screen readers, and honors user locale conventions when relevant.\\n\\nConclude with a comprehensive footer that acts as both a map and a signature. Provide quick links that mirror the primary navigation as well as deep links (top projects, blog categories, speaking, newsletter, open-source). Add a concise bio line or mission statement, contact email, and social icons with descriptive labels. Include legal and operational details—copyright, license or usage notes for any shared assets, a last-updated date, and a link to a privacy policy. Consider a mini newsletter signup with double opt-in and a plain-language description of frequency and content. Keep the footer visually calm with reduced contrast and smaller type, but maintain sufficient legibility. Offer a “back to top” affordance and ensure landmarks (header, main, footer, nav) are correctly defined so assistive technologies can jump between them quickly.\\n\\nSupport these sections with a cohesive system that elevates the entire experience. Establish a restrained color palette with accessible contrast, a type scale that balances expressive headings with highly readable body text, and spacing rules that create rhythm and clarity. Select two complementary fonts—one for display, one for text—and define consistent letter-spacing and line-height. Use a clear grid, generous margins, and a single-column mobile layout that progressively enhances to multi-column on larger screens. Provide consistent component states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled), visible focus outlines that meet WCAG guidelines, and gentle motion that follows the principles of easing, duration, and delay tuned to content importance. Keep performance top of mind: minify assets, inline critical CSS, defer non-critical scripts, compress images, and preconnect to required origins. Add structured data (Person, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, and for projects, CreativeWork or SoftwareSourceCode), set descriptive meta titles and descriptions per page, and use an open graph/Twitter card configuration with compelling preview images.\\n\\nImplement robust accessibility and internationalization practices from the start. Use semantic HTML5, ARIA only where necessary, and form controls that are properly labeled. Provide alt text that conveys purpose, not decoration. Respect prefers-reduced-motion and prefers-color-scheme. Ensure sufficient color contrast and large, consistent tap targets. Support keyboard navigation with logical tab order and visible focus indicators; test with screen readers. Prepare for localization by separating copy from code, avoiding hard-coded date formats, and choosing libraries that handle pluralization and right-to-left layout if needed. Write copy that is plain, direct, and helpful; avoid jargon unless your audience expects it, and explain acronyms on first use.\\n\\nRound it out with thoughtful content strategy and credibility signals. Keep the narrative consistent across all sections: a short promise in the hero, evidence in projects, context in about, and an easy path to contact. Add a blog or notes area if you intend to publish regularly; if not, keep the site lean and focus on quality over frequency. Consider a changelog or “Now” page to share what you’re working on, reinforcing authenticity. Use a lightweight analytics solution that respects privacy and yields actionable insights without invasive tracking. Provide a favicon set and app icons; test social previews; check 404 and empty states with friendly copy. Back up the site, configure monitoring for uptime, and set up automated deployments so updates are safe, reversible, and fast.\\n\\nIn the end, ensure each section works independently but sings together: the header that orients, the hero that persuades, the projects that prove, the about that humanizes, the contact that invites, and the footer that steadies. The result is a personal website that feels intentional, accessible, performant, and genuinely yours—well organized for first-time visitors, robust enough for returning readers, and ready to grow as your work and story evolve.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Plan: create index.html, styles.css, App.jsx, components.
